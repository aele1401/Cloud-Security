# Cloud Network
This is a collection of Linux and Ansible scripts along with a detailed network diagram from my ELK project. 
Most of the scripts were used to configure cloud servers with different docker containers.
The final setup was 3 servers running vulnerable DVWA containers along with a jump box and a server running an ELK stack container.
